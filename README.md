# MusicRecommendation
Objective In this task, we predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the userâ€™s very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise in the training set. The same rule applies to the testing set. KKBOX provides a training data set consists of information of the first observable listening event for each unique user-song pair within a specific time duration. The use of public data to increase the level of accuracy of your prediction is encouraged. Use Logistic Regression Train on a portion of the dataset Test the trained model against the remainder of the dataset Accuracy can be determined because the dataset is labeled (i.e., this uses supervised learning)
